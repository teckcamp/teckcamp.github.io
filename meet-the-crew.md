### The Team

#### Admiral Megan

<a href="https://www.twitter.com/MeganKSlater"><img style="float: left;" alt="Admiral Megan" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meetup-mates/meetup-mates.github.io/master/img/MS-%20MM%20Admiral%20Pic%20New%20white.png" width="200"></a>Megan is Community Advocate at Tecknuovo. She has worked within the tech community as an organiser, cheerleader and general busy body for the past 3 and a half years, and couldn’t imagine interacting with a more passionate and vibrant group of people. When she’s not running between meetups, she can be found surrounded by too many dice or in a field wearing armour. She’s always open to board game recommendations!

#### Captain Kat

Heading up the Marketing & Community Team at Tecknuovo Kat has quickly immersed herself in the tech Meetup scene and found her home at Meetup Mates, where everybody who’s interested in technology is welcome. When she’s not at work, Kat loves to spend time with her foodie friends finding interesting places to eat out. With a Masters in Classics, she loves to read historical fiction and spends as much time as possible in Italy.
