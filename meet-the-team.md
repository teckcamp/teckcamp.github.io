### The Team

#### Megan

<a href="https://www.twitter.com/MeganKSlater"><img style="float: left;" alt="Follow Megan on Twitter" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teckcamp/teckcamp.github.io/master/img/MeetTheCrew_MS.png" width="200" title="Follow Megan on Twitter!"></a>Megan is Community Advocate at Tecknuovo. She has worked within the tech community as an organiser, cheerleader and general busy body, and couldn’t imagine interacting with a more passionate and vibrant group of people. When she’s not running between events, she can be found surrounded by too many dice or in a field wearing armour. She’s always open to board game recommendations!

#### Kat

When she’s not at work, Kat loves to spend time with her foodie friends finding interesting places to eat out. With a Masters in Classics, she loves to read historical fiction and spends as much time as possible in Italy.
