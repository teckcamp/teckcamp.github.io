<a id="Privacy Policy Top"></a>
According to the various laws and higher powers we have no control over, in order to legitimately ask you for any personal information (like your name, last name and email address), add you to the Slack channel and e-mail you, we need to have a privacy policy. We also need you to read it, so you can definitely understand how we will be processing your data. 
This policy explains the way that we collect, use and protect your data as well as your choices with regard to your data.

We’ve tried to be as clear as we can be and to avoid unnecessary jargon, while including all the relevant information, but if anything doesn’t make sense, or you simply want to talk with a human about the data side of Teck Camp, please email the Teck Camp team at [teckcamp@tecknuovo.com](mailto:teckcamp@tecknuovo.com?Subject= Teck Camp Privacy Policy). Thanks!

**<a id="The data we collect about you and how we use it"></a> 3. The data we collect about you and how we use it**

For registered members we store username, first name, last name, email address; public discussions you may have on Teck Camp Slack Channel; and a summary of decisions we’ve taken about you if we’ve reviewed your use of Teck Camp Slack Channel for any reason (please refer to the Code of Conduct). Registered members may also have given us more data on sign up like favourite meetups to attend.

We store your email address to register you and contact you (if you have asked for email newsletters) and we store things such as cookies so that our systems recognise you if you return to Teck Camp Website. 

We don’t require your address when you view Teck Camp content or register with the site, and you can use Teck Camp fully without providing it.

Subject to your permissions and choices (as explained later) we collect, store and process the data listed in this section. We believe we provide a useful service, and therefore have a legitimate interest in processing your data which benefits both Teck Camp and you as a Teck Camp user.

<details>
 <summary><b>We store the following data for all users, whether registered or not:</b>
  <br>
IP address, cookies, device type – to identify your web browser and device. </summary>
 
We also use Google Analytics to report on page views in aggregate to help us understand usage trends. We do not pass your personal data to Google and your IP address is anonymised before we share this information with Google Analytics. Google uses cookies and can learn about your browsing on Teck Camp to inform Google ads and other Google services, as explained here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners">https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners</a>
 
 </details>

 <details>
 <summary><b>We store the following information for registered members:</b>
  <br>
Email address, First Name and Last Name</summary>
 
So that we can add you to the slack channel, and to inform you about any changes to the community privacy policy, cookie policy and the code of conduct. If you choose to join Teck Camp, we also may ask for your Twitter or LinkedIn Account so that we can check that you’re a real person (to prevent ‘bots’ signing up). We won’t send you newsletters or mass email communications that you haven’t asked for, and we don’t sell your email address to anyone else.

We also store discussions that take place over email or via Private Messages between you and Teck Camp Admins on Slack's public channels – so that we have a record.
 
 </details>

<details>
<summary><b>We also store the following optional data for registered members:</b><br>
Permissions to email you, to send you newsletters that you have chosen to receive from Teck Camp.</summary>

Data that you provide when taking part in surveys, panels, product tests, quizzes or competitions. For these things, we sometimes ask for your name, email or other data required for the competition (such as your email address). Before recording or passing this information to another organisation (for example a prize provider), we will provide the organisation’s data policy and clearly ask for your permission each time.

If you visit multiple pages or come back to Teck Camp after a break, cookies mean we do not count you as a new visitor. Using cookies like this allows us to compile aggregate statistics about how many users Teck Camp has and how long people use the site for, on average. We share this anonymous information with advertisers. Understanding what’s well-used on Teck Camp means we can create more of what users find useful and less of what they don’t.*

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.

You should review such privacy policies, terms, and other agreements before you submit any personal information to these services.
  
We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

**<a id="Data security"></a>8. Data security**

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. 

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

**<a id="Data retention"></a>9. Data retention**

**How long will you use my personal data for?**

Any personal data you give us, or that we collect when you use Teck Camp, will be retained by us for as long as it’s needed to perform its function. Registration data is held permanently unless you deregister, or if you're inactive for over 60 days. There’s no one-size-fits-all time limit, but we regularly review the data we hold to ensure it is still necessary.

**No fee usually required**

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What we may need from you**

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time limit to respond**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated. 

**<a id="Complying with the law and best practice around data"></a>11. Complying with the law and best practice around data**

The way we store and process data is compliant with the [UK 1998 Data Protection Act](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/UK-Data-Protection-Act-1998-DPA-1998), the [2018 EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eugdpr.org/), and other relevant pieces of legislation. We always aim to comply both with the spirit as well as the letter of the law and to be responsible with your data.
The way that we store and process data is compliant with the following legislation:
 - UK Data Protection Act 1988 (DPA)
 - EU Data Protection Directive 1995 (DPD)
 - EU General Data Protection Regulation 2018 (GDPR)
 - ePrivacy Directive 2002 (amended 2009)
As well as keeping up-to-date with laws about data, we aim to take sensible decisions based on common sense, listening to users’ views and industry best practices.

**<a id="If our data is compromised"></a>12. If our data is compromised**

If our security is breached, our data is compromised or if we fail to comply with the law, we will tell affected users as soon as we become aware of the failure. We will report any data breach to the Information Commissioner and, if appropriate, the police, in a timely fashion.

Used appropriately, we strongly believe using data improves the user experience on Teck Camp and supports our aim of growing an inclusive community of meetup attendees. Data you give us when filling in forms on site (when joining, for example) or when you're using the site or our apps helps us show you more relevant things and improve Teck Camp for everyone.

If, via human error, or via a breach of our security, we fail to comply with the law, we will let affected users know as soon as we are aware of it. We will report any data breach to the Information Commissioner in UK and, depending on the circumstances, the Police.

<details>
 <summary><b>Glossary</b><br>
  All the jargon we've used above explained</summary>
<br><br>
<b>LAWFUL BASIS</b>
<br><br>
<b>Legitimate Interest</b> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.
<br><br>
<b>Performance of Contract</b> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.
<br><br>
 <b>Comply with a legal obligation</b> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
<br><br>
 <b>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</b>
<br><br>
You have the right to:
<b>Request access to your personal data</b> (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
<br><br>
<b>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.</b> This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
<br><br>
 <b>Request erasure of your personal data.</b> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. 
<br><br>
Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
<br><br>
 <b>Request restriction of processing of your personal data.</b> This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: 
 <ul>
<li>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</li>
<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. </li></ul>

<br>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. 
<br><br>
<b>Withdraw consent at any time </b>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
